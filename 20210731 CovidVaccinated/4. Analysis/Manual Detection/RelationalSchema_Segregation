Segregation of a single file into 2 searate file:

1. The first file contains the covid vaccinations on a daily basis

2. Second file has statistics of the total vaccinations per some intervals due to the preence of nulls in most of the data. Hence, creating a visalisation for just the data present will be much more useful and efficient.
A total of 15276 rows had blank cells.
Usage of WHERE to segregate the data

WHERE [total_vaccinations] <> ' '
